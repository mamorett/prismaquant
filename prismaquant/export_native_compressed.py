"""export_native_compressed.py — materialize a PrismaQuant recipe as a
standard `compressed-tensors` checkpoint that vLLM serves natively.

This is the unified export path. Decoder layers are streamed from
safetensors one at a time: the model skeleton is built on meta via
`init_empty_weights`, head + embed + norm + lm_head + rotary stay
resident, and each decoder layer flows disk → quantize → emit → unload.
Small models pay the no-op cost of a LayerCache large enough to keep
everything resident; big models (Qwen3.5-122B at 244 GB BF16) fit
through the same path on a 121 GB host.

Reads the per-tensor format assignment produced by `allocator.py`
(layer_config.json) and emits a directory containing:

  - `model-*.safetensors` (sharded), with each Linear / packed-MoE
    tensor written under the standard compressed-tensors schema:
        <name>.weight_packed         (uint8, 4-bit packed for NVFP4)
        <name>.weight_scale          (fp8_e4m3fn for NVFP4 / e8m0 for MXFP8)
        <name>.weight_global_scale   (fp32, NVFP4 only)
        <name>.input_global_scale    (fp32, A4/A8 formats only)
    OR `<name>.weight` (passthrough bf16) for layers in the BF16 bucket.

  - `model.safetensors.index.json` matching the safetensors layout

  - `config.json` carrying a `quantization_config` with
    `format = mixed-precision` and one config_group per nominated
    format. Targets are explicit per-Linear regex anchors so vLLM's
    compressed-tensors dispatcher routes every parameter to the right
    scheme without ambiguity.

  - `mixed_native_manifest.json` summarizing the export (format
    histogram, ignore list, source recipe path) for traceability.

  - tokenizer / config files copied verbatim from the source.

Why this exists separately from llmcompressor's oneshot:
  - llmcompressor's QuantizationModifier matches nn.Linear modules. It
    does not handle 3D packed-expert tensors (Qwen3.5/3.6's
    `gate_up_proj` / `down_proj`), which silently fall back to dense
    bf16 in the standard pipeline.
  - llmcompressor pins transformers <5; transformers v5 is required to
    load Qwen3.6 (`qwen3_5_moe`). The two cannot coexist.

This exporter pins to transformers v5 for model load, uses the
compressed-tensors lib's `pack_fp4_to_uint8` reference (inlined to
avoid the lib's transformers-coupled `__init__`), and writes the
on-disk layout directly. vLLM's existing `compressed_tensors` and
`compressed_tensors_moe_w4a4_nvfp4` schemes load the result without
patches.

    """Apply the proper-AWQ fold pass in-place on one resident decoder
    layer.

    Invariant established per predecessor γ:
        γ      ← γ / s
        M.W    ← M.W * s  (for every reader M of γ — Linear or packed)

    For each predecessor γ we:
      1. Enumerate every reader (all formats: NVFP4, MXFP8, BF16, packed
         experts). The `_awq_discover_layer_readers` helper finds them.
      2. Compute the joint scale `s` from cached activations of the
         NVFP4 readers ONLY. The scale represents "which channels need
         more FP4 quant grid budget" — an NVFP4-specific quantity. Non-
         NVFP4 readers don't contribute to the scale but ARE scaled by
         it so the identity holds.
      3. If no NVFP4 reader has cached activations (e.g. only BF16
         readers), skip this γ entirely — no fold.
      4. Fold `γ /= s` once, and multiply every reader's weight by `s`
         on the input dim in-place. For nn.Linear, scale `.weight.data`
         on columns (dim 1). For packed experts, scale the 3D param
         `.data` on dim 2 (`[E, out, in]`).

    Returns `{recipe_key -> s}` for every NVFP4 LINEAR reader (only —
    packed experts and non-NVFP4 readers don't appear). This dict is
    used downstream by `_quantize_2d` to divide cached activations by
    `s` when running GPTQ / activation-weighted rounding: at runtime
    the reader sees `a/s`, so the importance weighting and covariance
    must match.
