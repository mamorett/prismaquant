"""allocator.py — multi-choice knapsack mixed-precision assignment.

Given:
  - per-Linear empirical Fisher diagonal trace (from sensitivity_probe.py)
  - per-(Linear, format) measured quantization cost (from measure_quant_cost.py)
  - a bit budget (target average bits per parameter)
  - a format registry (any subset of registered formats)

Solve for a per-Linear format assignment that minimizes total predicted
loss increase subject to the bit budget.

Derivation of the per-(layer, format) predicted loss term
---------------------------------------------------------
Let L be the per-token loss (negative log-likelihood). Quantizing layer
ℓ's weight tensor W by ΔW = W_q - W produces a perturbed loss whose
expectation under the calibration distribution admits the standard
second-order expansion:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · ΔW · F · ΔWᵀ                         (1)

where F is the Fisher information matrix of L w.r.t. W. Replacing F by
its diagonal (the standard HAWQ-V1 simplification) and approximating
F_ww by the empirical Fisher diagonal F̂_ww = E_token[(∂L/∂W_w)²]:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · Σ_w F̂_ww · (ΔW_w)²                   (2)

Under the further assumption that the per-weight quantization error
(ΔW_w)² and the per-weight Fisher diagonal F̂_ww are uncorrelated across
w (which is the same assumption HAWQ already makes when it summarizes a
layer by a single scalar), this collapses to the product of two
per-layer scalars:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · H_trace · MSE_W                       (3)

where
    H_trace = Σ_w F̂_ww            (per-token Fisher diagonal trace)
    MSE_W   = (1/n_w) · Σ_w (ΔW_w)²

Both quantities are produced by upstream stages:
    H_trace ← sensitivity_probe.py / FisherAccumulator (`h_trace`)
    MSE_W   ← measure_quant_cost.py (per-(layer, format) `weight_mse`)

So we use eq. (3) directly. There is no `* d_out` factor; the previous
implementation carried one but it does not appear in the derivation —
it was a holdover from an earlier output-side formulation that mixed
units and was off by a per-layer multiplicative constant that varies
with d_out.

For MoE experts an additional route-probability normalization is folded
into H_trace inside the probe so that sparsely-routed experts' Fisher
contributions are on the same per-token footing as dense layers'.

Solver:
  Multi-choice knapsack via DP with bit-budget discretization (we round
  bit costs to 0.001-bit bins). For 35B with ~300 Linears × 8 formats ×
  ~5000 budget bins, runtime is under 1s.

Fused-projection siblings (q/k/v/o, gate/up, ...) are post-processed:
  all siblings promoted to the highest format chosen for any of them,
  to match vLLM's fused-tensor loader constraints. Since promotion can
  push achieved bits past the requested budget, the DP is re-run with a
  tightened target until achieved is within tolerance.

Optional empirical calibration:
  If `--calibration` points at a JSON produced by calibrate_allocator.py
  containing `calibrated_gains[fmt] = α_fmt`, the predicted Δloss for
  format f is multiplied by α_f before the DP runs. This corrects for
  systematic over- or under-prediction per format observed against
  measured KL on the bake-off frontier.

plus a few flanking points so you can eyeball.

    vLLM's FusedMoE kernel requires a single format per layer's fused
    expert tensor. Per-expert mixing is only possible via slow unfused
    serving paths. Statistically, per-expert Fisher is also noise-
    dominated at typical calibration budgets, so aggregation gives
    cleaner signal too — both correctness arguments point the same way.

    This function:
      1. Groups Linears by (expert_group_path, projection_suffix), e.g.
         `model.layers.5.mlp.experts.*.gate_proj` becomes one group.
      2. Builds a synthetic "super-Linear" per group in returned stats_ext
         and costs_ext, with aggregated params/sensitivity/RTN errors.
      3. The super-Linear's `n_params` = Σ_i n_params_i (so MSE_W terms
         can be aggregated as a parameter-weighted mean).

    The aggregated predicted Δloss for the super-Linear at format f is
    the sum of per-expert predicted Δlosses, which under the closed-form
    formula 0.5 · h_i · mse_i,f decomposes cleanly:

        sum_pred(f) = Σ_i 0.5 · h_i · weight_mse_{i,f}

    To make the super-Linear behave identically under
    `predicted_dloss(h, mse, ...)` (which uses one h and one mse), we

        h_super  = Σ_i h_i                (sum of per-expert Fisher trace)
        mse_super(f) = sum_pred(f) / (0.5 · h_super) if h_super > 0 else 0

    With that, `0.5 · h_super · mse_super(f)` reproduces sum_pred(f)
    exactly. The super-Linear's `out_features` is preserved as the
    expert's true `out_features` so downstream code that consults it
    (e.g. the bake-off summary) sees a real shape, not a sentinel.
