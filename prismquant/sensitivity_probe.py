"""sensitivity_probe.py — per-Linear empirical Fisher diagonal trace.

What this measures
------------------
For each tracked Linear with weight W, this script estimates the
per-token empirical Fisher diagonal trace

    H_trace = Σ_w E_token[(∂L/∂W_w)²]

where L is the per-token negative log-likelihood (same loss a language
model is trained against) and the expectation is over a calibration
corpus. This quantity is used by allocator.py as the sensitivity score
in the closed-form predicted Δloss

    Δloss ≈ 0.5 · H_trace · MSE_W                           (eq. 3 in
                                                             allocator.py)

Naming. The literature uses several names for E[(∂L/∂W)²]: "empirical
Fisher", "Gauss-Newton diagonal", "gradient-squared". This is NOT the
true Hessian diagonal — for that you would need a vHv-style probe
(Hutchinson). The empirical Fisher equals the Hessian only at a true
loss minimum, which a calibration corpus does not in general satisfy.
For ranking layers and predicting first-order quantization sensitivity,
empirical Fisher is the standard HAWQ-V1 choice and works well.

How the per-token estimator stays unbiased
------------------------------------------
HuggingFace's `out.loss` is `mean(CE)` over the T tokens in a batch, so
its gradient is `(1/T) · Σ_t ∂CE_t/∂W`. Squaring that under-estimates
per-token Fisher by a factor of T (under the standard assumption of
independent per-token gradients). To avoid that, we reconstruct CE with
`reduction="sum"` for the backward pass; the gradient then aggregates
per-token gradients without the 1/T factor, and dividing the
accumulated `||grad_W||²_F` by total tokens recovers the per-token
Fisher trace estimator directly.

Other features:
  - route-aware MoE scaling (discover routers by walking module tree;
    divide each expert's H_trace by observed routing probability so
    sparse experts' Fisher is comparable to dense layers')
  - per-token importance weighting (harder tokens count more); this
    reweights the loss but preserves the per-token-Fisher units when
    used with sum reduction
  - activation snapshot cache for measure_quant_cost.py

Memory:
  - params requires_grad_(False)   → no gradient tensor storage
  - gradient checkpointing on      → activations are recomputed during backward
  - backward hooks reduce grad_w to a scalar inline and drop it
Result: peak ≈ model weights + one-block activation, fits in 128 GB for 35 B.

Model-agnostic:
  - Router discovered via module walk (any Linear whose out_features equals a
    sibling ModuleList named experts, gates, etc.)
  - Top-k read from model.config (num_experts_per_tok)
  - Dense models just skip RouterTracker
