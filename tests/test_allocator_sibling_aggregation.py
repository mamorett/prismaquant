"""Tests for the allocator's fused-sibling pre-aggregation path and the
convergence-based iteration stop in `solve_with_promotion`.

Fused-sibling coupling (q/k/v must share one format, gate/up must share
one format) used to be enforced as a post-pass (`promote_fused`) that
inflated the achieved bpp above the target whenever the DP picked
different formats for siblings. The new `aggregate_fused_siblings`
pre-pass collapses each sibling group into a single DP candidate, so
the knapsack can't pick mixed-sibling solutions and the overshoot
vanishes.

These tests pin:

  - aggregate_fused_siblings respects the profile's fused_sibling_group
    and groups 2+-member groups while passing singletons through
  - The super-Linear's per-format predicted_dloss equals the exact sum
    of member predicted_dlosses (MoE aggregation already guarantees
    this mathematically; we replicate it here for siblings)
  - expand_fused_sibling_assignment broadcasts the super-Linear's
    chosen format back to every member
  - Pre-aggregation + DP achieves the target bit budget exactly, vs
    the post-promote pipeline which overshoots
  - solve_with_promotion stops early when consecutive iterations stall
